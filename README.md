Sense is a practice project for Tailwind CSS, built with Nuxt 3 and TypeScript. The goal is to refine styling skills using utility-first CSS while leveraging Nuxtâ€™s flexibility and TypeScriptâ€™s type safety.

### Tech Stack Used:

- Nuxt 3
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript

### My Usual Stack:

- React
- Vite
- CSS-in-JS (tss-react)
- TypeScript
- React Router (actually type-route)
- MUI
- Storybook

I was able to transfer some of my knowledge, but there's still a lot to learn. So yeah, **don't judge too harshly**â€”this was just me experimenting ðŸ¥¹
